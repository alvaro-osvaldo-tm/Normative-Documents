# README

It's a taxonomy to classify the repository's artefacts, it's a work in progress and lacks of elements descriptions. 

It was decided to be organised into directories due the facility to manage in a Directory explorer as "Windows Explorer", "KDE Dolphin" or "VSCode" and be easily integrated into Git.


Many of these taxonomy organisation come from the relationship 'part-of' on [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) english portal, an example how to interpreted is showed in section below.

## Example

**The structure:**

- Architecture 
	- Enterprise Architecture

**Means:**

For each artefact classified in the 'Enterprise Architecture' means the artefact use foundational 'architecture'  knowledge domain specialised in their application into 'enterprise' knowledge domain.
