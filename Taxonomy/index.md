# README

It's a taxonomy to classify the repository's artefacts, it's a work in progress and lacks of elements descriptions.

It was decided to be organised into directories due the facility to manage in a Directory explorer as "Windows Explorer", "KDE Dolphin" or "VSCode" and be easily integrated into Git.

Many of these taxonomy organisation come from the relationship 'instance of' and 'subclass of' described on [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) english portal. Each element added to this repository was made under a [System Practitioner](<../Viewpoints/Engineering/Systems Engineering/System Practitioner.md>) viewpoint.

An example how to interpreted the taxonomy is showed in section below.

## Example

**The structure:**

-   Architecture
    -   Enterprise Architecture

**Means:**

For the structure 'Architecture' , there is a substructure named 'Enterprise Architecture'.

For each artefact classified in the 'Enterprise Architecture' means the artefact use foundational 'architecture' knowledge domain specialised in their application into 'enterprise' knowledge domain.
