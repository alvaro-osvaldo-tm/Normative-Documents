# Obsidian

A note-taking tool , also can be used as a text editor for [markdown](../../../../Normatives/Documentation/Documentation%20Standards/Common%20Markdown%20Standard.md) , also their support for [mermaid](../../../../Normatives/Documentation/Diagraming%20Standards/Mermaid.md) is compatible with [VSCode](../../../Engineering/Software%20Engineering/IDE/VSCode.md).

However for profitable organisations the tool will require purchase a license and can lack support for multi-support editing.

## Rationale

Obsidian was choose to be a low-cost tool that require low computer resources and provide features with plugins.

However, a better approach it's to use a multi-user tool like [WikiJS](WikiJS.md), capable to support Git-based repositories and multi-user editing.
