# Integrated Development Environment

If no specific decision is made for the system, users with [Development Role](../../../Roles/Engineerings/Development%20Role.md) CAN decide their own Integrated Development Environment.

However , for this normative documents repository a few IDEs are recommended and ensured all configurations are compatible.

## Rationale

These IDEs are not recommended as being the best solution for their cases , but it's a starting point for the system development.
